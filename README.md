A test API build written in Python. It serves as a simple backend for a theoretical ecommerce website or similar sales portal. The app creates a database with USER, ITEM, and ORDER tables (with ORDER tracking USERs who purchased an ITEM) and sets up API endpoints that allow information to be added and retrieved from the database.

To set up the project, db_config.py must be run first to establish the database and the appropriate tables.
